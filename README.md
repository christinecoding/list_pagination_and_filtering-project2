Project 2: List Pagination and Filtering 

This project uses the "pagination" technique in JavaScript to enhance the usablility of the webpage. The HTML document contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. The JavaScript creates a series of links at the bottom of the web page that lets users click through the list of students, 10 entries at a time. The JavaScript code is designed to work with a list of any number of students, not just the 54 in this project.
